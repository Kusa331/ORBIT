I would like you to help me create a full system based on the following complete functional prototype of a project called ORBIT (Integrated Library Facility & Computer Usage Management System). This system is designed to digitize and streamline the manual processes of booking and reserving facilities at a university library, managing computer logins and usage in the Online Resource Zone (ORZ), and providing administrative oversight for both. I want the system to be built based on the following detailed requirements and interface workflows.

General Overview:
The system must serve students, faculty, and administrators through two integrated subsystems:

ORZ Computer Usage and Login System

Online Library Facility Booking System

Each subsystem must have:

Secure user login

Role-based access (Student, Faculty, Admin)

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) aligned with the provided Figma design

Session tracking

Reporting features

Admin dashboards

ORZ Computer Usage and Login System
For Students:
Students must log in with their credentials via a login GUI.

The login screen must include a "Terms and Conditions" link before proceeding.

Once logged in, students are shown:

Their active computer session

Remaining usage time

If inactive for 10 minutes, the system should automatically log them out to free the workstation.

If they need more time, they can:

Request a time extension through a pop-up interface.

The request must be approved by an administrator.

The system must show a confirmation notification for extension approval.

For Administrators:
Admins log in with:

Username and password

Acceptance of terms and conditions

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

After login, admins access an administrative dashboard to:

View all usage logs (active and past sessions by time and user)

Force logout, manually extend sessions, or monitor usage

View session details or ban users

Includes Security Management module:

Monitor unauthorized logins

View system alerts and suspicious activity

Manage banned users

Change password and enable 2FA

Report Generation:

Generate daily, weekly, or custom reports for usage, login history, and bans

Account Settings: Modify credentials and system preferences

Online Library Facility Booking System
For Students and Faculty:
Login using credentials with separate interfaces for each group

View and accept terms and conditions

After login:

Select facility to book (e.g., study room, faculty lounge)

View available rooms

Submit a reservation request by entering date, time, and purpose

Review and submit booking information

Receive confirmation pop-up

Prompt to check email for booking approval

Users must present Student ID and booking confirmation when using the room

After submission:

Return to the facility list

View Booking History with reservation status

View available rooms and pending reservations

For Administrators:
Login with credentials, terms agreement, and 2FA

Access admin dashboard with:

Notifications

Overview of facility usage

Perform Manual Booking on behalf of users with no system access

View Booking Facility Log, filterable by date or room

Manage Bookings:

Approve, decline, or reschedule

View detailed info per booking

Security Management:

Monitor and track unauthorized access

Report Generation:

Generate reports for facility usage and login history

Account Settings: Customize system preferences and admin credentials

System-Wide Features:
Centralized access for both subsystems

GUI must follow the structure and flow from the Figma prototype

Emphasis on security, user experience, and role-based workflows

Must include automatic logs, pop-up notifications, and email alerts

Should be modular and scalable for future expansion:

Mobile access

Biometric login

More facility types (labs, conference halls, etc.)

Deliverables You Should Generate:
Database schema (user roles, logs, bookings, sessions, etc.)

Frontend UI (login screens, dashboards, pop-ups)

Backend logic (authentication, session management, admin controls)

Admin and User Dashboards

Email notification system for approvals

Reports module with export options

Optional features: mobile-friendly layout, analytics panel

Please generate code, architecture, and implementation steps to begin building this system. Ensure all functionalities described above are included in the system scope.
